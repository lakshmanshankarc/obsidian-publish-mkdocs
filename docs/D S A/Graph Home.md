# Graph Data structure

### what is a graph ?

1. non linear data structure represented using nodes and edges
2. two forms of graph representation
    1. matrix representation
    2. adjacency matrix
3. useful for representing networks, relationships etc..
4. used widely in social networks like linked-in and other social media platforms

### Example

![main.excalidraw(3).png](data%20structures/D%20S%20A/Graph%20Data%20structure/main.excalidraw(3).png)

The above is the basic graph which connects 5 nodes from 1 - 5. 

1. `Nodes/vertices` are represented using `circles` .
2. `edges` are represented using the `lines.`
