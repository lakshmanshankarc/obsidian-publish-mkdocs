# undirected Graph

These types of graph have no directions in edges

1. The can be traversed from source â†’ destination or even destination to source
2. Example Facebook friends Kind of bidirectional Relationship

# Example

## Weighted undirected Graphs

Just add weights to edges, think of like distance between nodes.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Traveling along the edges can cost u the weight associated with it

</aside>

the cost of traveling form 1 â†’ 3 is `4` like wise u can calculate

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Dijkstraâ€™s is the popular algorithm for shortest path. More about this on traversal page

## Cycles

These are the directions that points to same nodes causing infinite loops

1. hash-set is used to avoid cycles in a graph
2.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ As u can see there is no direction this graph might contains cycles

</aside>

Example

`1` â†’ `3` â‡’ `4` â‡’ `2` â‡’ `1`  which can be possible
