# Directed Graph

These types of graph have directions in edges

1. The can be traversed only in the directions
2. example Instagram Followers

# Example

This is similar to normal Graph But You can traverse along directions of the edges

## Weighted Directed Graphs

Just add weights to edges, think of like distance between nodes.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Traveling along the edges can cost u the weight associated with it

the cost of traveling form 1 â†’ 3 is `4` like wise u can calculate

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Dijkstraâ€™s is the popular algorithm for shortest path. More about this on traversal page

## Cycles

These are the directions that points to same nodes causing infinite loops

1. hash-set is used to avoid cycles in a graph

ðŸ’¡ Thatâ€™s All for directed Graphs.
